When you open the page of this game, it will randomly select a word within its word bank that you must guess with only five mistakes.  In order to make a guess, you hit one of the letter keys on your keyboard.  If you are correct, it will fill in that letter at the correct spot in the word.  If you are wrong, it will tell you so and lower the number of mistakes that you can make in this round of guessing the word.
